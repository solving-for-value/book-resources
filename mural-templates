We have made our work available in the form on MURAL templates which you are able to use yourselves and edit for your own situations.

### Templates

#### Product Wall

The Product Wall template is designed to help teams visualize, organize, and prioritize product features, requirements, and tasks. It provides a collaborative space where all stakeholders can contribute and track progress in real-time.

1. Populate the Wall: Begin by adding key product elements that are relevant to you. You can see the ones we've used for Magnum Opus, but the boxes/sections aren't fixed. You are able to swap out different pieces to maximize transparency.
2. Collaborate in Real-Time: Use the template to facilitate discussions among team members. Everyone can contribute their thoughts, add comments, or adjust priorities, ensuring a dynamic and inclusive workflow. Maybe it could live on a 'team home page' or similar?

By leveraging this Product Wall template, youâ€™ll enhance collaboration, transparency, and efficiency throughout the product lifecycle.
